### I just want a website ! <a name="help-me-im-desperate"></a>

You have plenty of options. "easiest" is probably just getting some paid wordpress hosting, buy a template and get to work.

I'm not one for the easiest of options. Right now if you only need a static site (content that doesn't change very often). Then I can't recommend the `JAM` stack enough.


### Core concepts <a name="core"></a>

Google's web overview is a good place if you alread have some advanced knowledge [link](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)


### General Javascript <a name="general-javascript"></a>



### React <a name="react"></a>

I've worked mainly as a frontend developer for quite some time that the list is going to be very biased toward frontend/react. Take that with a grain of salt. 



### Node <a name="node"></a>


### Design ### Node <a name="design"></a>


#### Inspiration ### Node <a name="inspiration"></a>

- Information is beautiful. Really lovely charts, very diverse, makes you think how to display different kinds of data sets. [link](https://informationisbeautiful.net/)




### Static sites <a name="static"></a>

#### JAM  <a name="jam"></a>

For my personal blog [mateom.io](https://mateom.io) I've used the JAM stack. I used `React`, `Gatsby` and `styled-components` and Gatsby converts all of that to a simple static website with html/css/js minified and super fast. To deploy it I just need to push to master and netlify will update it for me automatically (this is not a paid endorsment by netlify. by all means use the service you want. `now.sh` is a popular one too)

To supercharge your JAM website you'd need things like functions

### Productivity

WTF does this have to do with web dev resources? Being more productive with our work gives us more free time to have some other interests or to binge watch another one of those bad TV series. Whatever rocks your boat.

Tim Ferris' book `Tools of Titans` summary and notes. Haven't read the book but this summary is enough for most people. Like everything treat it with a grain of salt. Correlation does not mean causation, and if you do everything these super successful people do, chances are you are still not going to be super successful :) [Link](https://www.toomas.net/2017/01/19/the-ultimate-tim-ferriss-tools-of-titans-book-summary-notes-review/)









## Aknowledgments

I created this because my bookmarks tab was getting unmanageable with 500+ and I didn't really want to waste all hours spent on twitter.

This was previously a Trello board but decided that it was growing too large for a board and it's always polite to share the juicy stuff. 

## Disclaimer

I haven't actually read/completed all these tutorials/resources. They just seemed cool at the time but some of them may actually be horrible. Please report them to me so I can take them down and keep some standard.
